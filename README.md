OR Management System
The OR Management System is a decentralized and intelligent platform that revolutionizes surgical scheduling. It directly addresses the critical challenges of outdated, centralized OT boards, which often lead to manual errors, communication delays, and inefficient resource allocation.

The Problem
Traditional surgical scheduling is a bottleneck. It relies on a single, manually updated OT board, creating a cascade of issues:

Delayed Communication: Crucial updates are not instantly shared with the surgical team.

Inefficient Scheduling: A lack of real-time data leads to surgical delays and poor resource use.

Increased Stress: The entire medical team is under constant pressure from uncertainty and last-minute changes.

Our Solution: A Decentralized and Intelligent Platform
Our system transforms surgical scheduling into a smart, collaborative platform. It uses a decentralized architecture, so critical information is no longer locked in one location. Instead, it is dynamically updated and accessible in real-time from any device used by surgeons, anesthesiologists, and nurses.

This approach provides:

Real-time Visibility: The entire surgical team can instantly see the status of all operating rooms and any schedule changes.

Enhanced Collaboration: Direct, seamless communication between team members reduces reliance on a central administrator.

Improved Efficiency: By minimizing delays and maximizing resource use, the system streamlines the entire workflow.

Reduced Stress: A more predictable schedule and real-time data allow medical teams to work more effectively.

The OR Management System creates a more transparent, efficient, and cohesive surgical environment, leading to better patient outcomes and smoother hospital operations.
