## ðŸ’¡ The Problem

Outdated, manual surgical scheduling methods create significant bottlenecks and challenges within hospitals:

* **Delayed Communication:** Critical updates on a patient's status or schedule changes aren't instantly shared with the surgical team.
* **Inefficient Scheduling:** A lack of real-time data leads to surgical delays, wasted time, and poor resource allocation.
* **Increased Stress:** Medical staff, including surgeons, anesthesiologists, and nurses, face unnecessary stress due to uncertainty and last-minute changes.

## ðŸš€ Our Solution

The **OR Management System** is a smart, collaborative platform built on a decentralized architecture. This approach ensures that crucial scheduling information is no longer locked in a single location. Instead, it is dynamically updated and accessible in real-time from any device used by the surgical team.

This platform provides:

* **Real-time Visibility:** The entire surgical team can instantly see the status of all operating rooms and any schedule changes, ensuring everyone is always on the same page.
* **Enhanced Collaboration:** Direct, seamless communication between team members reduces reliance on a central administrator, promoting a more cohesive workflow.
* **Improved Efficiency:** By minimizing delays and maximizing resource use, the system streamlines the entire surgical workflow, optimizing every step from preparation to recovery.
* **Reduced Stress:** A more predictable schedule and the availability of real-time data allow medical teams to work more effectively and with less pressure.
